I am Siyuan Li from Sun Yat-Sen University. I will graduate in 2024 and I am seeking a Ph.D./MPhil position. I majored in Finance and Economics and also interested in Fintech, social media research, statistics and philosophy. You are welcomed to read my works both on this website and on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/SiyuanLi-Sven). I have a GPA of 3.6/4, ranking about 50% at our college. I got an IELTS score of 7.5 (Listening 8.5; Reading 8; Writing 6.5; Speaking 6.5), and a CET-6 score of 599.

I planned to become a staff member in the Investment Banking Department when I was a greenhand at university but changed my mind after spending more than a whole year as an intern in financial companies. I made up my mind to be an influential researcher rather than an insignificant intermediary. I consider that being a researcher in the academic field is closer to my goal.
