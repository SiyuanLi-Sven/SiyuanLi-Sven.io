excerpt: "[Working paper] This article explores the Hume problem of whether factual judgments can be derived from value judgments. In the first part of the article, the author organized the origin and evolution of the Hume problem. The second and third parts of this article respectively criticize and expand the Hume problem from two perspectives: the division of what should be and what should be, and the logical inevitability of the concept of value. The fourth part of this article is the author's reflection on the inevitability of 'hypothesis is conclusion' and deductive reasoning when studying the Hume problem."
