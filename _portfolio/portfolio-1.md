This is an electronic shackle design based on brain-computer interface technology. When the sensor system determines that the prisoner is in a nervous state and has a certain possibility of committing a crime, it drives the atomizer to spray liquid with a pungent smell to wake up the surrounding crowd. Shu Yu from South China University of Technology led the project, and I was responsible for the parts related to embedded development.
